                      **Markdeep Feature Demo**
                           Morgan McGuire

This demonstration documents the features of
[Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep) and acts as a test for
it.  Markdeep is a text formatting syntax that extends Markdown, and a
Javascript program for making it work in browsers. The two most
powerful features are its ability to run in any **web browser** on the
client side and the inclusion of **diagrams**.

[Click here](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html?noformat)
to see this document without automatic formatting.

Markdeep is free and easy to use. It doesn't need a plugin, or
Internet connection. There's nothing to install. Just start
writing in Vi, Nodepad, Zed, Emacs, Visual Studio, Atom, or another
editor! You don't have to export, compile, or otherwise process
your document.

If you want to support development of Markdeep, you can
[sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/morgan3d) these projects on GitHub
for $2 or just buy my [Graphics Codex](http://graphicscodex.com) book for $10 on Amazon. 
Revenue from the book funds my open source projects.


Basic Formatting
=======================================================================================
Text formatting: 

    Source                               |     Result
-----------------------------------------|------------------------------
`**bold**`                               | **bold**
`__bold__`                               | __bold__
`*italic*`                               | *italic*
`_italic_`                               | _italic_
`~~strikethrough~~`                      | ~~strikethrough~~
<code>`inline code`</code>               | `inline code`
`[news](https://cbc.ca)`                 | [news](https://cbc.ca)
`https://casual-effects.com`             | https://casual-effects.com
`morgan@casual-effects.com`              | morgan@casual-effects.com
`5 kg/m^3`                               | 5 kg/m^3
`5 degrees`                              | 5 degrees
`x<sub>below</sub>`                      | x<sub>below</sub>
`<small>size</small>`                    | <small>size</small>
`<big>size</big>`                        | <big>size</big>

You can add CSS to change the styles. See the Custom Formatting section
for some examples.

Formatted text may **cross
lines** and be as small as **a** single character. It can _also
  be indented and
  split across lines_ simultaneously.

Markdeep intelligently does not apply bold or italic formatting to
math expressions such as x = 3 * y - 2 * z or WORDS_WITH_INTERNAL_UNDERSCORES.
It also protects HTML `<tags>` in code blocks from disappearing.

If you _want_ italics or bold inside of a word, for example in: SCUBA = <b>S</b>elf <b>C</b>ontained
<b>U</b>nderwater <b>B</b>reathing <b>A</b>pparatus, then just use HTML `<b>` and `<i>`
tags---a markdown syntax won't be any more readable in that case.

Exponents only work for positive and negative integers. For arbitrary exponents,
use LaTeX notation: `$x^y$` ==> $x^y$, or HTML tags: `x<sup>y</sup>` ==> x<sup>y</sup>.

Links
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many forms of implicit and explicit links:


         Source                            |   Result
-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
`[hyperlink](http://casual-effects.com)`   | [hyperlink](http://casual-effects.com)
`[hyperlink]("http://casual-effects.com")` | [hyperlink]("http://casual-effects.com")
`<http://casual-effects.com>`              | <http://casual-effects.com> 
`http://casual-effects.com`                | http://casual-effects.com
`morgan@casual-effects.com`                | morgan@casual-effects.com
`test@foo.co.uk`                           | test@foo.co.uk
`<test@foo.co.uk>`                         | <test@foo.co.uk>
`Lists section`                            | Lists section
`Tiny Grids subsection`                    | Tiny Grids subsection
`Section Lists`                            | Section Lists
`Subsection Lists`                         | Subsection Lists
`Section [lists]`                          | Section [lists]
`sec. [lists]`                             | sec. [lists]
`subsection [lists]`                       | subsection [lists]
`table [states]`                           | table [states]
`tbl. [states]`                            | tbl. [states]
`Table [states]`                           | Table [states]
`figure [robot]`                           | figure [robot]
`fig. [robot]`                             | fig. [robot]
`Figure [robot]`                           | Figure [robot]
`lst. [sort]`                              | lst. [sort]
`listing [sort]`                           | listing [sort]
`Listing [sort]`                           | Listing [sort]
`[New York Times][nyt]`                    | [New York Times][nyt]
`[Google][]`                               | [Google][]
`footnote [^syntax]`                       | footnote [^syntax]
`[#Kajiya86]`                              | [#Kajiya86]

Any section header name followed by "section", "subsection", or "sec." will automatically be
linked to that section. (The keyword "chapter" currently works but is unsupported and likely to
change to work differently with multi-file documents in the future.)

To link by number, use one of those key words followed by the section
name in brackets. This won't work if you use the actual word "section" _as the title of a
section_...but it would be unexpected to have a section named "section" in a real document
anyway.

You can also insert HTML anchor (`<a>`) tags to create arbitrary internal links.

When linking to a Markdeep document from another document, you can refer to sections
based on either a mangled version of their name or a fully-qualified version of that.
The mangling is URI encoding of the section name with spaces removed, in all lowercase.
For example, this section can be linked to as 
`features.md.html#links` or `features.md.html#basicformatting/links`.

**The easiest way to generate a link to a section is to simply
right-click (or ctrl-click) on that section header in the
browser. This will bring up a context menu that allows you to copy
either the internal Markdeep text of the link or the external HTML
code link.** While a hover would be more discoverable, I chose to use
the context menu so that this functionality would work well on touch 
screens, be easier to style for themes, and not affect layout.

Reference-style links include arbitrary formatted text in brackets
followed by a case-insensitive symbolic name that must be defined
elsewhere in the document:

- Example using a symbolic name: [New York Times][nyt]
- Example using the text as its own symbol: [Google][]

Put the definitions at a convenient location elsewhere in the document:

~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
    [nyt]: http://nytimes.com
    [google]: http://google.com
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Markdeep also supports footnotes, endnotes [^syntax], and citations
[#Kajiya86] using a similar syntax. The actual notes and bibliography
may be placed at the bottom of the document:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~none
    [#Kajiya86]: James T. Kajiya. 1986 ...

    [^syntax]: Endnotes look like ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple citations (but not footnotes) may be included within brackets:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~none
...the early Monte Carlo rendering methods [#Cook84, #Kajiya86].
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Regular links may also have attributes, for example,
[this link will directly download](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/robot.jpg download).

URLs in explicit links may be surrounded by optional `"` quotation `"` marks. If your URL
contains parentheses, then it _must_ be surrounded in quotation marks to make it unambigious:

- [a link with parens]("http://casual-effects.com(bar)")
- []("http://casual-effects.com(bar)")

URLs with various forms of special characters are handled well even without quotation marks:

- [hyperlinks to URLs with underscores](https://archive.org/stream/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1_djvu.txt)
- https://archive.org/stream/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1_djvu.txt

You can also use the CommonMark angle bracket syntax
`<http://foo.com/bar?arg=value&hello>` ==>
<http://foo.com/bar?arg=value&hello> provided that your URL only
contains lower-case letters. Otherwise the browser interprets it
as a tag and converts it to lowercase before Markdeep runs.

(SIGGRAPH '86)_, ACM, 143-150. http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/15922.15902


[^syntax]: Endnotes look like reference-style links with an empty text
field. Endnotes may not contain multiple paragraphs (sorry, David
Foster Wallace), although they may refer to _other_ endnotes.

Lists
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A blank line or line ending in a colon must precede lists. Lists have lines that begin with a
number (which is not required to increment) and a period, or a bullet character (-, *, +). They
can also be nested. Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Monday
2. Tuesday
  1. Morning
  2. Afternoon
3. Wednesday
  - Bullets
  - Bullets
1. Thursday
  + Bullets
  + Bullets
1. Friday
  * Bullets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples of lists and floating diagrams:
                                                   *****************************
1. Monday                                          *   A         B         C   *
2. Tuesday                                         *   *-------->o<------->o   *
  1. Morning                                       *   ^        / ^        |   *
  2. Afternoon                                     *   |       v   \       v   *
3. Wednesday                                       *   o----->o---->o<---->*   *
  - Bullets                                        *   D      E     F      G   *
  - Bullets                                        *****************************
4. Thursday
5. Friday


A list with just bullets:
- Bread
- Fish
- Milk
- Cheese


A  list containing a code block:

1. This is the first list item.

   ~~~~~~
   // This is a code block
   if (x > 0) printf("hello!\n");
   ~~~~~~
   
1. This is the second list item.


- Level 1
 - Level 2
  - Level 3
- Level 1 again


- 1
 - 1.a
  - 1.a.i
  - 1.a.ii
 - 1.b

Lists can also:

* Use asterisks
* Instead of
* Minus signs
* `or have code`
* *and* other formatting

or

+ Use plus
+ Signs


Lists with blank lines between the elements are formatted with more spacing. There's actually
nothing special about this...that's just the regular paragraph separator.


1. Here's a list with some large elements that I chose to format by putting a blank line
   between the elements to make them more visually distinguished.

2. That's necessary with paragraph-sized elements; otherwise the
   text would appear to run together into a wall of text!
    
   - You can also
   - Nest lists within lists with spaces


Lists that begin with a number other than 1 use that number as the start index. The subsequent
numbers are irrelevant and automatically replaced with ascending numbers:

6. A list that starts at six!
1. and just
1. keeps going...


Task Lists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the strikethrough syntax for task lists:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. ~~completed~~
  1. ~~subtask~~
1. uncompleted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which will format as:

1. ~~completed~~
  1. ~~subtask~~
1. uncompleted

or, use github or streamlined checkbox syntax for task lists :

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
github:
- [x] completed
  - [x] subtask
- [ ] uncompleted

streamlined:
[x] completed
  [x] subtask
[ ] uncompleted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

github:
- [x] completed
  - [x] subtask
- [ ] uncompleted

streamlined:
[x] completed
  [x] subtask
[ ] uncompleted



Definition Lists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
    the family Rosaceae.

    Multiple paragraphs are supported.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

    - Can also
    - Put lists
    - In definitions

Definition lists with short definitions are formatted more tersely:

Grapes
: Available in purple ("red") and green ("white") varieties.

Bananas
: Only yellow.


Schedule Lists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Schedule lists contain titles that begin with a valid date. After the
title, arbitrary indented content appears, including lists, text, and
equations:

~~~~~~~~~~~~none
Tuesday Feb 16, 2016: Project Launch
 - Create specifications
 - Initialize revision control system
 
Friday Feb 19, 2016: Build Milestone
 - Build system fully functional
 - Placeholder unit tests committed
                  ⋮

(Monday Feb 29, 2016): Office Closed
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the schedule is sufficiently long and dense, then a calendar preview
is shown before it. Entries in parenthesis with no further details
are formatted with a more subtle style.

Formatted schedule lists
look like:

Tuesday Feb 16, 2016: Project Launch
 - Create specifications
 - Initialize revision control system

Friday Feb 19, 2016: Build Milestone
 - Build system fully functional
 - Placeholder unit tests committed
 
 _Plan for weekend overtime if we miss this milestone_
 
Wednesday Feb 24, 2016: Site Visit
 **Whole team vistits client**. Dress appropriately.

Friday Feb 26, 2016: Demo Milestone
 - Internal demonstrations for management
 - QA reports due

(Monday Feb 29, 2016): Office Closed

Tuesday Mar 1, 2016: Code Freeze
 - Commit final features before this date
 - Only priority 1 fixes with issue tracking numbers
   after this point

Monday Mar 7, 2016: Beta

Wednesday Mar 16, 2016: Gold

Dates can be in any unambigous format that includes a month, day, and
four-digit year between 1000 and 2999, such as:

- 2001-03-01
- 1 Apr. 1999
- 4-07-1976
- February 16, 2016
- 2020 Jan. 15
- May 15th, 1982

The US date format MM/DD/YYYY is not supported because it is
ambiguous. The date may include the name of a day of the week
(e.g., Sunday). It will be replaced with the correct day.

When months are given by name, they must match the localization
settings.


Block Quotes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Email-style indenting creates a blockquote:

> This is an indented blockquote: Ut at felis diam. Aliquam massa odio, pharetra ut neque sed, commodo
> dignissim orci. Curabitur quis velit gravida, blandit diam nec,
> lacinia quam. Maecenas pharetra, velit in vestibulum auctor, diam
> ipsum suscipit arcu, non sodales orci nibh sit amet leo. Nulla dictum

Blockquotes formatted in the style of an actual quotation receive
special treatment for fancy quoting:

> "You want to make it seem alive and effortless and fun, but that's an
> art that took me 25 years to really learn. I wanted to do it very much
> 25 years ago, but I didn't know how."
>
>      -- David O. Russell, director of American Hustle

Page Breaks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To support other markdown conventions, `\pagebreak` and `\newpage` will insert a page break in
a document when printed or converted to PDF. You can also use a pattern of a series of five `+`
signs on their own line, which will form a horizontal rule on screen and a new page when
printed.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To make top-level section headers also force page breaks, add the following to your
document or CSS file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;style&gt;.md h1, .md .nonumberh1 {page-break-before:always}&lt;/style&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Images
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's no natural way to embed an image into a document that is also readable as plain
text. Markdeep follows markdown's somewhat reasonable syntax.  The source

`      ![A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)` 

becomes:

![A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)

Optional labels may be applied:

`      ![Figure [robot]: A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)` 

![Figure [robot]: A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)

Any text after the URL is used as HTML attributes. If the attributes
include width or height specifications, then the image is linked to
the original.

````
![Figure [robot2]: A picture of a robot with a caption larger
than it.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")
````

![Figure [robot2]: A picture of a robot with a caption larger
than it.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")

![Really long captions are justified, not centered. This happens 
  automatically when the caption spans multiple lines. You can also use custom CSS to 
  change the formatting of captions.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")

![Captions may contain [links](https://casual-effects.com), but not other images.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")

![Floating robot with a large caption.](robot.jpg width="20%") If the image is embedded in a
paragraph and has a caption, then it floats right and any width
specification is propagated to the full captioned image, for example, 
the image to the right of this paragraph. Use a space as your caption
if you want this behavior but don't actually want a visible caption.

You can also just use a raw HTML `<img>` tag: 

`       <img src="robot.jpg" width="128" border="2">`

<img src="robot.jpg" width="128" border="2">

Captionless images work as well. Source `![](robot.jpg)` becomes:

![](robot.jpg)

Images are centered if they appear in their own paragraph block and
inlined otherwise. Grids of images are recognized and laid out as
grids using HTML tables:


![1](robot.jpg width=100) ![2](robot.jpg width=100) ![3](robot.jpg width=100)
![4](robot.jpg width=100) ![5](robot.jpg width=100) ![This image has a<br/>long caption](robot.jpg width=100)

Images may be shown pixel-perfect under zoom (which is good for computer graphics/computer
vision results and pixel art) by attaching the `pixel` CSS class:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
![Pixel perfect image](invader.png width=150px class=pixel)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

![Pixel perfect image](invader.png width=150px class=pixel)


Reference Images
----------------------------------------------------------------

Markdeep introduces a new feature called "reference images". These have several nice properties:

* Put long image URLs elsewhere in the document for clarity
* Indirection so that multiple images can reference a symbolic URL
* Embed [base64 encoded images as data URIs](https://www.base64-image.de/) directly in a Markdeep text file


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
![This is a base64 embedded reference image][hasselhoff.png]

<!-- This can appear anywhere in the document. I recommend putting it at the bottom.  -->
[hasselhoff.png]: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

![This is a base64 embedded reference image][hasselhoff.png]

The syntax is the same as CommonMark reference _links_, just with square brackets. 
You can use all of the Markdeep image features with reference images, including 
image grids, floating images, and images with attributes.

Videos
----------------------------------------------------------------

Video file extensions are automatically detected and will embed a small video
player:

     ![A video](rocket.mp4)


URLs for Youtube and Vimeo videos will also automatically embed a video player:

![State Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgPMyvZMBY0)

![Figure [fig:boy]: The Boy with a Camera For a Face](https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/151493973)

URLs for images may be surrounded in optional `"` quotation `"` marks. If your URL contains
parentheses, then it _must_ be surrounded in quotation marks to make it unambigious. 

Recall that URLs are not permitted to contain spaces (by their specification), so to embed
a local image whose filename has a space, either rename the file or replace the spaces
with `%20` in the URL version of the name.


Audio
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MP3, WAV, OGG, etc. audio for music and podcasts are supported using the same
syntax as for images and video:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
![The Personal Best CBC Podcast](https://podcast-a.akamaihd.net/mp3/podcasts/personalbest-GRHHTnR3-20180415.mp3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creates:

![The Personal Best CBC Podcast](https://podcast-a.akamaihd.net/mp3/podcasts/personalbest-GRHHTnR3-20180415.mp3)



Symbol Substitutions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Markdeep converts `<->`, `<==>`, `->`, `-->`, `<-`, `<--`, `==>`, and `<==` to arrows if they
aren't in a code block or latex expression and are surrounded by whitespace. Examples:

- if this ==> then that
- here <== there
- this <==> that
- A <- B
- X -> Y
- back <-> forth
- long --> way
- back <-- there

Two or three minus signs are converted to an em dash--like that.

An "x" between numbers, such as 1920x1080 or 3 x 4 x 6, will be
converted to the times symbol.

Negative numbers, such as -5 and minus signs between numbers such as 
2 - 1, will have a minus sign instead of a hyphen.

Degrees are reformatted to the degree symbol:

- Cold, 37-degree F water.
- A 45-degree angle.
- A right angle's measure is 90 degrees. 

It doesn't reformat the word "degree" when not following digits:

- Don't give me the third degree!
- I have two degrees from MIT.

"Smart quotes" are applied for double-quote marks based on position
relative to whitespace:

"a" b c

a "b" c

a b "c"

a "b!" c

a "b," c

a "b". C

a, "b" c

a---"b"---c

a ("b") c

"error" ==> "correction"

Inch or minute markers such as 3' 9" are not converted. Quotation
marks in <span style="color:#F00">HTML attributes</span> and
in code blocks, e.g., `var x = "hello world"`, are not converted.


Admonitions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Admonitions are small break-out boxes with notes, tips, warnings, etc. for the reader. They
begin with a title line of a pattern of three exclaimation marks, an optional CSS class, and an
optional title. All following lines that are indented at least three spaces are included in the
body, which may include multiple paragraphs.

The default stylesheet provides classes for "note" (default), "tip", "warning", and "error".
These are case insensitive and ignore any colon after the CSS class. Here are some examples:

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` none
!!!
    I'm a note. Don't mind me, I'm just sitting here.

!!! note
    Another note.

!!! Tip
    Close the door on the way out.

!!! WARNING
    I'm a warning, perhaps. *Something might happen!*

!!! ERROR: Seriously
    Watch out, something **bad** could happen.

    This is still more error text.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

!!!
    I'm a note. Don't mind me, I'm just sitting here.

!!! note
    Another note.

!!! Tip
    Close the door on the way out.

!!! WARNING
    I'm a warning, perhaps. *Something might happen!*

!!! ERROR: Seriously
    Watch out, something **bad** could happen.

    This is still more error text.


Fenced Code Blocks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set off large blocks of code using equal-length strings of tilde `~`
or back-tick <code>`</code> characters. Each produces a different CSS
class so that they can be styled differently. 

By default, tilde blocks have lines before and after them and are
inset for use as code listings instead of large inline code
blocks. Both styles receive syntax coloring and automatic programming
language detection.

You can override automatic programming language detection by putting
the name of the language immediately following the first fence. The
supported languages are (capitalization ignored):

`bash cs C# cpp C++ css coffeescript html XML http JSON java JavaScript Makefile`
`markdown objectivec Objective-C PHP perl python ruby shell armasm glsl go haskell`
`kotlin lisp lua matlab R rust scheme swift tex typescript yaml PyxlScript none`

You can specify a custom CSS class for a code block by placing its
name after the language name.

<pre>
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C</code>
void insertion_sort(int data[], int length) {
    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
       ...
    }
}
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code>
</pre>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C
void insertion_sort(int data[], int length) {
    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
       ...
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Alternative back-tick markup:

````````````````````````````````````
def insertionSort(data):
    for i in range(0, len(data)):
        j = i;

        while (j > 0) and (data[j] < data[j - 1]):
            temp = data[j]
            data[j] = data[j - 1]
            data[j] = temp
            --j
````````````````````````````````````

### HTML and LaTeX Blocks

You can even have HTML in a code block:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<b>Show this</b> HTML as <i>source</i>,
<code>not code</code>.
<img src="robot.jpg">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`<img src="robot.jpg">`

`````````
<img src="robot.jpg">
`````````

LaTeX and other languages that use dollar signs work fine inside code
fences:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ \int_0^1 x^2 dx $

$$$a = $$$e
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...and of course, Markdeep inside Markdeep:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Do not 
- Format
  - this as a **list**!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Code Blocks with Captions

Code listings may have captions:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
def insertionSort(data):
    for i in range(0, len(data)):
        j = i;

        while (j > 0) and (data[j] < data[j - 1]):
            temp = data[j]
            data[j] = data[j - 1]
            data[j] = temp
            --j
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Listing [sort]: An insertion sort]

If you don't have a lot of exposition to share, then code blocks can be back to back:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
printf("Hello\n");
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
printf("World\n");
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


### Line Numbers

Adding the `linenumbers` CSS class to a listing makes line numbers appear:


<pre><code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python linenumbers</code>
def insertionSort(data):
...
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code>
</pre>


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python linenumbers
def insertionSort(data):
    for i in range(0, len(data)):
        j = i;

        while (j > 0) and (data[j] < data[j - 1]):
            temp = data[j]
            data[j] = data[j - 1]
            data[j] = temp
            --j
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Multi-code Blocks and Custom CSS 

You can interlace different languages or CSS classes within a single code block, but each is required
to specify the language in this case. This is convenient for highighting lines or showing the 
trace of an interactive session.

An example of a fenced code block with a CSS class and custom styling:

<pre>
&lt;<script>document.write('style&gt;')</script>
.md code &gt; .input  { font-style: italic; }
.md code &gt; .output { font-weight: bold; background: #FF7; margin-left: -20px; padding-left: 20px}
&lt;<script>document.write('/style&gt;')</script>

<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python input</code>
>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> [y * 2 for y in x]
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none output</code>
[2, 4, 6, 8]
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python input</code>
>>> x + [5]
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none output</code>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code>
[This listing combines multiple code blocks to show the input and output of an interactive section.]
</pre>

And its result:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python input
>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> [y * 2 for y in x]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none output
[2, 4, 6, 8]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python input
>>> x + [5]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[This listing combines multiple code blocks to show the input and output of an interactive section.]

### Less-than Signs in Code ###
#### Summary ####

Less-than and greater-than signs (`<` and `>`) do not need to be escaped in diagrams or code
as long as they do not appear immediately adjacent to a letter. Usually adding spaces or
using inline code backquote escaping will suffice even in those cases.

If you have trouble with less-than and greater-than signs right next to capitalized
letters in code blocks, do _one_ of the following:

- Put spaces after angle brackets: `std::vector< Capitalized >`
- Use HTML entity escapes: `std::vector&amp;lt&#xFEFF;Capitalized&amp;gt&#xFEFF;`
- Wrap code examples in `&lt;sc&#xFEFF;ript type="preformatted"&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;`
- Wrap your whole document in `&lt;sc&#xFEFF;ript type="preformatted"&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;`

<!-- The following list uses Unicode characters that look like ASCII
     but aren't, in order to prevent Markdeep and HTML from processing
     the code examples themselves. Do not copy from the document or you'll
     copy those invisible characters. Instead, see the actual code
     examples farther down the page. -->
     
You don't need to do this for legal HTML or XML in code blocks.

#### Details ####
Less-than and greater-than signs are allowed in code blocks
(as well as anywhere else in Markdeep), and will be handled
correctly if they are followed by a whitespace character.

Likewise, legal HTML and XML are correctly processed as code
when in code blocks.

However, because browsers interpret "`&lt;`" _immediately followed by_
a character as an HTML tag, less-than signs without a following space
must be formatted more carefully in shell scripts and languages such
as C++ and Java.

If the character following the less-than sign is lower-case, for
example in: "`std::vector&lt;int&gt;`", then no consideration is
needed. If the character following less-than is a capital letter, then
the browser will automatically make it lower case. If the following
character is a slash, then the browser will interpret it as a stray
tag and automatically remove it.

If you care most about being able to read your document in a browser
when the markdeep.js script is not available (due to no local copy and
no Internet connection), then either use surrounding whitespace or
use HTML entity codes to avoid incorrect processing of less-than signs.

**Reformatted Examples:**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#include &lt;foo.h&gt;
ls < /dev/null
ls&amp;lt;/dev/null
std::vector< Capitalized > array;
std::vector&amp;lt;Capitalized&amp;gt; array;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you care more about not having to reformat your code examples, then
just include them in preformatted `&lt;script&gt;` blocks:

**Script Block Examples:**

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~
#include <foo.h>
std::vector<Capitalized> array;
ls</dev/null
~~~~~
</script>

You can also include your entire document in a preformatted script
block to avoid the need for marking up each code (and inline code)
example.

If there is no leading text on the left except for whitespace, a diagram may omit the asterisks on the
right side for convenience:

Styling Diagrams
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  background: #333;
  stroke: #FFF;
  fill: #FFF;
}

.md .inverse svg.diagram .opendot {

You can use CSS to style all diagrams or individual diagrams. For example,
the following has light lines on a dark background:

Horizontal Rules
========================================================================

Following the CommonMark specification, any of these patterns can be used (and extended across
a whole line, of course) to produce a horizontal rule:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
-----

- - -

_____

_ _ _

*****

* * *
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example:

-----

- - -

Embedded Math
========================

Markdeep automatically includes [MathJax](http://mathjax.org) if your
document contains equations and you have an Internet connection. That means
you get the **full power of LaTeX, TeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation**.
Just put math inside single or double dollar signs. 

$$ \Lo(X, \wo) = \Le(X, \wo) + \int_\Omega \Li(X, \wi) ~ f_X(\wi, \wo) ~ | \n \cdot \wi | ~ d\wi $$

You can also use LaTeX equation syntax directly to obtain numbered
equations:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\begin{equation}
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{linear}
\mathbf{A}^{-1}\vec{b} = \vec{x}
\end{equation}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\begin{equation}
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{linear}
\mathbf{A}^{-1}\vec{b} = \vec{x}
\end{equation}

You can then reference those equations by name in the same way as figures, tables,
and listings: `See eqn. [linear]` ==> See eqn. [linear].

If you don't have equations in your document, then Markdeep won't
connect to the MathJax server. Either way, it runs MathJax after 
processing the rest of the document, so there is no delay.

Markdeep is smart enough to distinguish non-math use of dollar signs,
such as $2.00 and $4.00, US$5, and 3$. Inline
math requires consistent spaces (or punctuation) either outside or inside
of the LaTeX dollar signs to distinguish them from
regular text usage. Thus, the following all work:

- $x^2$
- $ x^2 $
- ($x^2$)
- ($ x^2 $)
- Variable $x^2$,
- Variable $ x^2 $
- Two $x$ vars $y$ on the same line
- Different spacing styles: $\theta_{x}$ vs. $ \theta_{y} $

Unless you've changed out the default MathJax processor, you can define 
your own LaTeX macros by executing `\newcommand` within dollar signs,
just as you would in LaTeX.  Markdeep provides a handful of commands
defined this way by default because they're things that I frequently 
need:

   Code            |   Symbol
-------------------|------------
 `\O(n)`           |  $\O(n)$
 `\mathbf{M}^\T`   |  $\mathbf{M}^\T$
 `45\degrees`      |  $45\degrees$
 `x \in \Real`     |  $x \in \Real$
 `x \in \Integer`  |  $x \in \Integer$
 `x \in \Boolean`  |  $x \in \Boolean$
 `x \in \Complex`  |  $x \in \Complex$
 `\n`              |  $\n$
 `\w`              |  $\w$
 `\wo`             |  $\wo$
 `\wi`             |  $\wi$
 `\wh`             |  $\wh$
 `\Li`             |  $\Li$
 `\Lo`             |  $\Lo$
 `\Lr`             |  $\Lr$
 `\Le`             |  $\Le$
 `\thetai`         |  $\thetai$
 `\thetao`         |  $\thetao$
 `\int x^2 ~\d{x}` |  $\int x^2~\d{x}$
 `10\un{m/s^2}`    |  $10\un{m/s^2}$


# ATX Headers
In addition to the underlined headers, you can also use ATX-style
headers, with multiple # signs:

## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
Although: do you really need six levels of subsection nesting?!

You can also create unnumbered sections that will not appear in the
table of contents using parentheses around the pound signs:

(##) Unnumbered H2


Multiple Columns
========================================================================
<div style="columns:2;-webkit-columns:2;-moz-columns:2;column-gap:3em;-webkit-column-gap:3em;-moz-column-gap:3em">
You can use the CSS
[columns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns/Using_multi-column_layouts)
style to make an HTML multicolumn block. Then, just use regular Markdeep within it and the
browser will automatically apply your multicolumn layout. 

Browsers are even smart enough to break the columns correctly when
printing to PDF or to a printer. However, for a long document,
multiple columns don't work well when displayed on screen. That's
because there are no discrete "pages" on screen to break columns. So,
the browser will make each column as long as the entire document,
which is probably not what you want.

So, multi-column only works well if you know that you have very short
sections (as in this example), or if you were planning on printing to
separate pages when done.
</div>


Custom Formatting
=========================================================================

Manual
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Markdeep uses CSS for styling. That means you can embed a style sheet
to override anything that you don't like about the built-in styling.
For example, if you don't want section numbering, just use:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<style>h1:before, h2:before { content: none; }</style>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Markdeep uses Markdown's syntax, even where I disagree with the
choices.  But you aren't stuck with that. Do you wish that Markdown
had specified single-asterisk for `*bold*`? You can have
that:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;style&gt;em.asterisk { font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; }&lt;/style&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of the list bullets (`+`, `-`, `*`) has its own CSS class. You
can use this, for example, to make `+` entries bold and `-` ones
use a circle:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;style&gt;
  li.plus { font-weight: bold; } 
  li.minus { list-style-type: circle;}
&lt;/style&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Style Sheets
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Latex Article

To match the default Latex article formatting, insert the following anywhere in your document:

<pre class="listing tilde">
&lt;<span>link</span> rel="stylesheet" href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/latest/latex.css?"&gt;
</pre>

### Dark 

For an aggressively-stylized document with a black background, insert the following anywhere in
your document:

<pre class="listing tilde">
&lt;<span>link</span> rel="stylesheet" href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/latest/dark.css?"&gt;
</pre>

### API Documentation

To use the API documentation template, insert the following anywhere in
your document:

<pre class="listing tilde">
&lt;<span>link</span> rel="stylesheet" href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/latest/apidoc.css?"&gt;
</pre>

### Presentation Slides

To create presentation slides as a PDF, insert the following into
your document, using first-level headers for sections and second-level
headers for slides:

<pre class="listing tilde">
&lt;<span>link</span> rel="stylesheet" href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/latest/slides.css?"&gt;
</pre>

Then, print the document to PDF.


Paragraph Numbering
--------------------------------------------------

Academic article or book proofs often have line numbers so that reviewers and editors can refer
to specific passages. This doesn't make sense for a document in a browser because line breaks
change based on the reader's screen size. 

You can add _paragraph_ numbers to your Markdeep document by including the following HTML at
the bottom of your document. You can remove the <code>&lt;</code>`style>` tag and place the code in a CSS file
as well.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ html
<style>
p::before {
  content: "¶ " counter(paragraph);
  counter-increment: paragraph;
  margin-left: -50px;
  width: 50px;
  height: 0px;
  overflow: visible;
  font-size: 70%;
  display: block;
  color: #666;
}
</style>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Localization
===================================================

There are two ways to localize the keywords such as Table, Diagram,
Monday, etc., from English to your favorite language.

The first is to
put a meta tag with a
[`lang`](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry)
attribute in the document, such as <`meta lang="ru"
charset="utf-8"`>. If your favorite language isn't supported by
Markdeep, just e-mail me a Javascript snippet with the appropriate
translations and I'll add it (see the source code for examples).

The second method is to manually set the `markdeepOptions.lang` field
before you include the script in your document.

When you've selected a language, keywords that you type such as
"figure", "listing", etc., the names of days and months, and any text
inserted by Markdeep such as "contents" will all be in that language.


Unicode (in UTF-8 encoding)
===================================================

To support Unicode input, you must add <`meta charset="utf-8"`> to
the *top* of your document (in the first 512 bytes).

Gravizo Support
===================================================

Markdeep diagrams have no dependency on third parties or the network 
(you can store the `markdeep.min.js` file locally on your machine!)
and look the same in your document as on screen in the final document.

If you need the full power of DOT/GraphViz automated layout graphs and
can accept a network and third party dependency, you can embed
[Gravizo](http://g.gravizo.com/) within a Markdeep document using either
direct Markdeep image syntax or an embedded HTML `img` tag:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<img src='http://g.gravizo.com/svg?digraph G { A -> B -> C; A -> C; }'>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<img src='http://g.gravizo.com/svg?digraph G { A -> B -> C; A -> C; }'>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
![](http://g.gravizo.com/svg?digraph G { A -> B -> C; A -> C; })
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

![](http://g.gravizo.com/svg?digraph G { A -> B -> C; A -> C; })


Markdeep also allows captions on Gravizo graphs and newlines within
the URL itself:

![Figure [graph]: A more complex graph example](http://g.gravizo.com/svg?
 digraph G {
   main -> parse -> execute;
   main -> init;
   main -> cleanup;
   execute -> make_string;
   execute -> printf
   init -> make_string;
   main -> printf;
   execute -> compare;
 })


Embedding Documents
===================================================

Markdeep in Markdeep
---------------------------------------------------

Markdeep can embed/insert/include other Markdeep documents inline, so that flow and
links between them work seamlessly and they share a single table of
contents. This is convenient for multi-chapter books, bibliographies,
boilerplate footers and headers, and styling. The syntax is:

<center>`(insert otherdocument.md.html here)`</center>

The inserted document must be a standalone Markdeep document, including the Markdeep line.  It
can have any file extension, although `.html` is recommended and there **must** be a period
in the filename to disambiguate it versus arbitrary TODO-style notes.

The included document will be inserted inline, meaning that footnotes, figure numbering, and
other kinds of references will flow correctly. Recursive inclusion is allowed. All paths in an
included document are relative to the original document. That's undesirable, and a future
release may be able to make those paths absolute.

Here is an example of embedding `example.md.html` into `features.md.html`:

            (insert example.md.html here)


Other File Types
---------------------------------------------------

It is not possible (for browser security reasons) to embed
non-Markdeep documents inline, however you can embed any type of
document that a web browser can read within a box. This includes
.pdf, .cpp, .h, .py, .json, and .txt files.

The syntax is simply HTML syntax:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ html
<iframe src="example.py"></iframe>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the result:

<iframe src="example.py"></iframe>

To change the height of the embedded box, add the height option:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ html
<iframe src="example.py" height=100px></iframe>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Differences from Other Markdown
===================================================

Features
---------------------------------------------------

There are many, inconsistent markdown variants. Markdeep intentionally differs from a few of
them in specific ways:

- Code blocks require fences; no indent-only code blocks. I think that allowing indentation to
  indicate code blocks was a poor choice in the original markdown specification because code
  vs. blockquote is ambiguous in plain text and it makes list detection harder.
  
- Two trailing whitespace characters do not force a hard newline. Use `<br>` or regular
  paragraph breaks if you need a hard newline. The original markdown specification on this
  point violates its golden rule that the input look as much as possible like the output,
  and that rule also ends up requiring special code editors/syntax highlighting to see 
  invisible characters, which is bad design.
  
- No bold/italic/strikethrough inside of words without spaces because they could form an
  equation or technical term. Just use HTML tags.

- Setext headers require at least three minus or equals characters to distinguish from
  multiline equations

- Whitespace required between `#` and the section name for ATX headers (disambiguates "#1" from
  a header; required by CommonMark)

- Markdeep's table reference syntax differs from MultiMarkdown's in order to provide a
  consistent formatting syntax across sections, figures, and tables...and one for which the
  source text is more readable.
  
- Blockquotes must be two lines long (use explicit HTML if you really need a single-line
  blockquote) or contain quotation marks to disambiguate them from lines where a greater-than
  sign just wrapped around.
  
- Escaped characters such as `\*` and `\_` are not needed, since Markdeep heuristics for
  determining when those characters are part of text and not formatting.


Temporary Limitations
---------------------------------------------------

Future releases likely will address these known bugs, limitations, and
"missing features":

- Tables and diagrams in lists create a new list
- Listings have a maximum caption length of three lines


Permanent Limitations
---------------------------------------------------

Due to the special protection from formatting that Markdeep affords `<pre>` and `<code>` tags
that appear in the document, you cannot nest a code tag inside of another code tag, and
likewise for pre tags.  Fortunately, it is pretty hard to imagine a case where you would want
nested code tags.
